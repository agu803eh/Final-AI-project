        "# prompt: Project Title: AI-Powered Health Monitoring System\n",
        "# Project Overview:\n",
        "# This project aims to develop an AI-powered system that monitors users' health in real-time using data from wearable devices (e.g., smartwatches or fitness trackers). The system will analyze health metrics such as heart rate, blood oxygen levels, and activity levels to detect anomalies and provide personalized health recommendations.\n",
        "# Key Features of the Project\n",
        "# Real-Time Health Monitoring: Collect and analyze data from wearable devices.\n",
        "# Anomaly Detection: Use AI to detect abnormal health conditions (e.g., irregular heartbeats, low blood oxygen).\n",
        "# Personalized Recommendations: Provide actionable health advice based on user data.\n",
        "# User-Friendly Interface: Develop a mobile or web app for users to view their health data and recommendations.\n",
        "# Project Implementation Steps\n",
        "# 1. Define the Problem and Scope\n",
        "# Objective: Build a system that monitors health metrics and provides actionable insights.\n",
        "# Target Users: Individuals who use wearable devices to track their health.\n",
        "# Key Metrics to Monitor: Heart rate, blood oxygen levels, sleep patterns, and activity levels.\n",
        "# 2. Data Collection\n",
        "# Data Sources: Use simulated data or APIs from wearable devices (e.g., Fitbit, Apple Health).\n",
        "# Example Dataset: Use publicly available health datasets like the PhysioNet Database.\n",
        "# Data Preprocessing: Clean and normalize the data for analysis.\n",
        "# 3. Model Selection\n",
        "# Task: Anomaly detection and health recommendation.\n",
        "# Algorithms: Use machine learning models like:\n",
        "# Random Forest for classification (e.g., normal vs. abnormal heart rate).\n",
        "# LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) for time-series data (e.g., predicting future heart rate trends).\n",
        "# Libraries: Use scikit-learn for traditional ML and TensorFlow or PyTorch for deep learning.\n",
        "# 4. Model Training and Evaluation\n",
        "# Training: Split the data into training and testing sets (e.g., 80-20 split).\n",
        "# Evaluation Metrics: Use accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score for classification tasks.\n",

        "\n",
        "*   The initial attempt to load the data from the specified paths failed due to a missing pandas import.\n",
        "*   Correct loading of `HR.csv` and `BVP.csv` involved skipping the first two rows and programmatically determining the start time and sampling rate from those rows to create an accurate datetime index.\n",
        "*   Missing values in the merged DataFrame were handled effectively using a combination of backward fill (`bfill`) and forward fill (`ffill`).\n",
        "*   Engineered features, specifically rolling mean and standard deviation over a 60-second window for both Heart Rate and BVP, were successfully added to the dataset.\n",
        "*   A simple threshold-based method was used to label anomalies in the data, resulting in an imbalanced dataset with 1965 normal instances and 76 abnormal instances.\n",
        "*   The RandomForestClassifier model achieved perfect precision, recall, and F1-score (1.00) on the test set for both anomaly classes, indicating strong performance on this specific dataset split.\n",
        "*   The trained model was used to predict anomalies on the entire dataset, and a simple rule-based system provided recommendations for detected anomalies.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Insights or Next Steps\n",
        "\n",
        "*   The perfect performance of the RandomForest model on the test set might indicate overfitting or that the anomaly definition using simple thresholds is easily separable by the model. Future steps should involve evaluating the model with more sophisticated anomaly definitions or on a separate, unseen dataset.\n",
        "*   The current recommendations are very basic. A more advanced system could use the magnitude or type of anomaly (e.g., high HR vs. low BVP) to provide more tailored and informative recommendations.\n"
